     <h2>Opinion</h2>
     <p>I enjoy this class not only because Dr. Evia is such a good teacher but it is also a very interesting class.
       Dr. Evia keeps our class interesting and loves to keep things upbeat with all this jokes.
       This class has taught me so many skills that I can use in the future with media.
       A lot of the things we have done in this class I have never done before but his directions are very helpful.
       He is also incharge of revamping the visual media classes here at Tech. You can tell that he is really
       passionate about what he does and thats why he is so good at revamping the department.</p>
     <h2> Expected Grade </h2>
     <p> I hope to get a B in this class. To get that B in this class I will have to do well on this project :)</p>
