     <h2> Description </h2>
     <p>Survey of chemistry across areas of specialization for students enrolled in curricula other than science and engineering.
       History and fundamental concepts and theories of chemistry, including the consequences of changes in parameters on chemical systems.
       Impact of chemistry in the context of areas of public concern and policy, including best practices for sustainability, rational decision-making, ethical use of scientific information, product and process stewardship.</p>
     <h2>Opinion</h2>
     <p>Chem in context is nice because it's an easy class for me. My other classes constantly have me working on important projects so it's nice to have one class that allows me to take a break.
       She tries to explain chemistry to people who aren't chem majors and keep it simple.
       I enjoy the class but can honestly say that I have not learned anything from her class. It is a CLE which means its not needed for my major.
       Because of this I'm not worried about the fact that I haven't learned much in the class.</p>
     <h2> Expected Grade </h2>
     <p>I hope to get an A in this class. Right now I am almost at an A but must do well on the last exam.</p>
